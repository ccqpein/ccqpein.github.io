title: Advent of Code 2023 journey
---

The AoC 2023 is finished! As the last year, I am going to record how is my AoC 2023 journey going in this post. This year I seek a lot helps from my friends in the chatting group we made last year, and the genious on Reddit. Truly learn a lot, like the several algorithms I didn't even heard about before. 

## Day 1 & 2 & 3 & 4##

The first day I was writing in rust and common lisp at the beginning. The code part is straightforward enough. I was still writing my parser by myself until my friend mention Regex Expression. I am so stupid, why I hadn't thought about it? So I re-wrote my day2 input parse with regex lib. In commaon lisp, I need to learn the `cl-ppcre` lib. 

After that, the day 3 and day 4, I was using regex to write parser and I am pretty like it. 

## Day 5 ##

My brute force way cannot work this time. Because SBCL on my M2 Silicon MBP give the `Heap exhausted (no more space for allocation)` error. It is weird that I didn't see the memory usage is that huge. So I call the help from my friend and re-write the major logic by caching more parts. And finally finish it with two stars.

## Day 6 ##

Day 6 it is interesting that I actually don't need the code to finish it. I can just solve quadratic inequality in one variable and give the answer directly. However, I forgot how to solve it now. It has been a looooong time from joniour high school. So I code to solve the part1. But part2, I google one online calculate to get the answer. 

## Day 7 ##

Need to make my own sort function and just replace it inside the `sort` function in lisp. I remember last year has the same type question. It is good for languages that can define the custome sort functions.

## Day 8 ##

Misunderstanding the input take me while to debug. It let me noticed that I need to check input too. It actually help me in day 20.

## Day 9 ##

My input parser forgot the negtive number, change from `\d+` to `-?\d+` just fix it.

## Day 10 ##

Day 10 is the day that difficulty incressing. The thing I learned from last year AoC called flood filling, I was trying to use it in this day's part2. But it doesn't work. Then I find a trick that when I scan a line, if they pass one direction, the empty spots after it are included, until reach the edge of other direction. It is tricky, I pretty sure it has some other algorithm like day18. But I hadn't check.

## Day 11 ##
