Someday, I want to use the `format` funcion inside my Rust. So I think I can write it by myself. And someone else can use it and feel a bit Lisp (just a tiny bit). 

After read some articles and study a bit, I usually just use it rather than look close enough to try to make a copy, I figured out there are two big parts I need to make separatly. One is control string, one is arguments input. And reveal them after all. 

I have to say, I thought it should be easy. But nothing is easy when put my hands dirty and facing those details. So, let the journey start.

## Control String ##

### Define Types ###

### Parser ###

## Wait, let's think a bit ##

## Traits ##

## Macros ##

## Arguments ##

## Optimization ##
