title: 2024 Review
---

Today is the last day of 2024, and here’s my review of how the year went. To sum it up, 2024 was a pretty straightforward year. I made several contributions to the open-source projects I use regularly.

## Contributions to Some Common Lisp Packages ##

I’ve been using `cl-str` since last year’s Advent of Code (AoC). This year, I contributed some improvements to it. Here’s a [list of my PRs](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Accqpein+is%3Aclosed).

One of my favorites is [this PR](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str/pull/114), which I’m particularly proud of.

Later in the year, I stumbled upon [ciel](https://github.com/ciel-lang/CIEL/pull/66) — a project that felt like a dream come true. It allowed me to use Common Lisp for scripting instead of Python. I can’t describe how exciting that discovery was.

## Maintaining Some Emacs Packages ##

2024 has been the breakout year for AI. With tools and models like Google Bard, Ollama,OpenAI, Claude, and others making waves, I wanted to use them in Emacs rather than relying on my Telegram bot. That led me back to the [chatgpt-shell mode](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Accqpein), which I hadn’t touched for a while. The tool has improved significantly since I last used it, and I decided to contribute [my own improvements](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Accqpein).

In addition to that, I also contributed to `lsp-mode` with [this PR](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/pull/4543). Specifically, I replaced the previous Python LSP backend with `ruff`, as I found it more efficient.

## Contributions to Some Rust Packages ##

Rust has also been on my radar for a while now. This year, I contributed to [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/2970), a rust-based modern replacement for `cat`. It's always fun working with tools that I actively use in my daily workflow.

## Some Interesting Learning Experiences ##

I encountered a few fascinating problems this year that taught me a lot. Here's a glimpse of what stood out:

### Why the Vec Grid in My Rust Tool Was So Slow ###
I ran into memory usage issues while warming up for AoC and recorded that journey in this [blog post](https://ccqpein.me/Why-the-Vec-grid-of-my-tool-is-that-slow-in-Rust/). It turned into an interesting exploration of memory tricks in Rust!

### Unsafe Implementation in Iterator ###
This was a follow-up learning experience after solving the previous problem. I wrote about it in [this blog post](https://ccqpein.me/Unsafe-Implementation-in-Iterator/). Debugging and optimizing iterators can be a deep rabbit hole, but it was rewarding to figure out.

## Advent of Code (AoC) Fun ##

### AoC 2015 ###
For fun, I tackled AoC 2015 back in March. It was a refreshing way to revisit older challenges.

### AoC 2024 ###
I also completed [this year’s AoC](https://ccqpein.me/Advent-of-Code-2024-Journey/). Once again, it was a great way to learn and polish my problem-solving skills.

## Wrap-Up ##

- I’ve always wanted to contribute to open-source projects. Without open source,I wouldn't even be a programmer, to be honest. This year, I realized that it’s easier (and more impactful) to contribute to packages and tools I actually use, rather than ones I just know about but haven’t worked with much.
- Moving forward, I hope to continue contributing to open source — and maybe even more.

Here’s to another enriching year ahead!
