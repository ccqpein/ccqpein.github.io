I have been using AI (LLM) for years, since the ChatGPT release 3.5. I also have made several thing with AI like:

+ telegram bot (make chatgpt api call through the telegram bot)
+ contribute open source AI project. 

ChatGPT was 10 bucks per month and I thought the api call was cheaper. And it trully is. Then now I am using the gemini api and gemini self. I have some thoughts of using AI these years

I use LLM in major purposes: general usage and tech stuff. Both of them give me some ideas and thoughts about how to use it. 

## General usage

General usage like helping me reading, query the information for me, give me the summary and comparing some ideas for me. 

### Ask question like stackoverflow

As the programer for years, I have read one article at the very beginning of my programer journal called [How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way](https://github.com/selfteaching/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/master/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way.md). Which is very helpful to me. Especially in the age that we still need to do tons of google search to get the answer we need. 

Now the LLM kind of the killer app for this job. But I find I still need the same guildline of how to ask the good question. I saw someone complain that LLM doesn't understand what's 

### Perfect matching my read habbits

## For tech stuff

some api usage is good
need more tests then
need more review than writing
rust's compiler is pretty helpful


developing treat llm client as tcp
use it as the api
